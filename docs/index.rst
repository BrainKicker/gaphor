About Gaphor
============

.. note::

   The documentation is up to date for Gaphor |version|

Gaphor is a UML and SysML modeling application written in Python.
It is designed to be easy to use, while still being powerful.
Gaphor implements a fully-compliant UML 2 data model,
so it is much more than a picture drawing tool.

You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects of a system
as well as create complete, highly complex models.
