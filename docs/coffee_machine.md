# Tutorial: Coffee Machine

In this tutorial we create a simple model of an espresso machine.
Why espresso? Well, it's the best kind of coffee there is. That's why.

A barista interacts with the espresso machine.
The barista is provided a simple interface with a few push buttons.

The espresso machine consists of a few components:

- A heating device
- a pressure device, we need around 9 bar
- A piston that needs to be filled with grinded coffee.
- something to capture spilled liquid
- a water resevoir
- a power supply

External devices include:

- a coffee grinder
- a cup
